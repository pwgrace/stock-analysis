# stock-analysis
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor a VBA script that analyzes stock price data for 12 different companies. The analysis outputs the total volume traded and return on a yearly basis, namely for the years 2017 and 2018. 
## Results
### 2017 Performance
This group of companies showed extreme volatility over the 2 year period. In 2017 5 of the 12 companies showed double digit growth and 4 of the 12 companies showed triple digit growth. All but one company ended 2017 with a higher stock price than when the year began. 
### 2018 Performance
2018 showed a reversal of fortune for all but 2 of the 12 companies listed. 6 of the 12 companies ended 2018 with double digit losses. 2 of the 12 companies managed to extend the gains that began in 2017.
### Overall Performance
Very little can be said about the investment potential of any of these companies without first viewing the fundamentals. It would be better to begin looking at the stocks with losses rather than gains to find value in order to target undervalued stocks rather than overvalued ones. 
### Execution Time
It is apparent that the refactored code showed marked improvement over the original script.
#### Original Code 2017
#### Refactored Code 2017
#### Original Code 2018
#### Refactored Code 2018
## Summary
### Refactoring Code Advantages and Disadvantages
There is an advantage to make code more efficient if the data set will be expanded in the future. If the data set was extended to include all public companies and all available years then the time saved would be become critical. The disadvantages would be the extra time spent refactoring the code that was already producing a working solution. 
### Pros and Cons to refactoring the original VBA script
Pros and Cons to refactoring the original VBA script
The differences in time saved are small when looking at only 12 companies for 2 years. It is helpful for the analyst to understand the problem more deeply so that lessons may be applied to future projects.
